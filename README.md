# AA_Portfolios_DSI
This repository contains three Portfolio files,  
### 1) Portfolio-Builder #1 : Reporting
   - Diamond Dataset 
   - Overview: 
      
      Diamond is the highest quality stone and one of the materials that has a geometric and symmetrical structure. It is composed of pure carbon and nearly colorless. There are 4 C’s (Cut, Color, Clarity and Carat) that play a role in a diamond’s beauty and all together present how the diamond looks. They are the key components that impact diamond beauty, structure and make each stone uniqe.
  
   - Objectives:

     our objective is to explore the diamonds dataset and identify the features of diamonds in the given dataset. Moreover, to show some technical skill I learned in Data Scinces Immersive course such us GitHub, R, Python, and Command Line. and not your nascent analytical skills.examine what of features affect the price of diamond. 
  
  
 
### 2) Portfolio-Builder #2 : Focus: Addressing a Research or Business Questions.

   - Breast Cancer Dataset
   
   - Overview:
   Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It is start when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control as a lump or from calcium deposition that leads to abnormal tissue in or around the breast tissue. It can be pre-cancerous (Benign) or cancerous (Malignant). In 2020, there were 685 000 death cases globally out of 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer. 
   
  - Objectives:
   In this portfolio, we aim to analyze the dataset of breast cancer diagnostic and determine how many women diagnose with malignant tumor. In addtion, this analysis is to prepare the dataset for next portfolio to build prediction model using machine learnign.

### 3) Portfolio-Builder #3 : Focus: Machine Learning Discovery.








Each Portfolio has specific instructions by Dr..Scavetta as a part of Data Scinces Immersive 2022 course at Misk 
Academy.
